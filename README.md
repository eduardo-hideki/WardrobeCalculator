# WardrobeCalculator
Simple calculator to design a simple wardrobe (WIP).

This code receives as an input some of the wardrobe measurements and prints out the sizes of the pieces to be cut from a board of wood (or any other material) taking into account some mounting hardware (such as rails for sliding doors) dimensions. 

Limatations: currently this code will only calculate measurements for a wardrobe with this type of structure (2 columns, 3 divisions in each):

</p>

Also, this code does **NOT** account for physics whatsoever, so depending on the measurements inputted, you could have a non-realistic sizing, balancing issues, etc. 

This code was made for personal use and thus it is only supposed to be just enough functional for its creator.
